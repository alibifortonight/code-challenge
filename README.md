# code_challenge

The "code_challenge" project is a full-stack application designed to manage and look up words and their synonyms efficiently. The backend is implemented in Go, providing REST API endpoints for word and synonym management, while the frontend is a React application that facilitates user interaction with the system. The project is structured to handle edge cases such as circular synonyms and large numbers of synonyms effectively.

## Overview

The application architecture consists of a Go backend and a React frontend. The Go backend handles REST API requests for word and synonym management, including endpoints for adding words, adding synonyms, and retrieving synonyms or words by their respective identifiers. The React frontend communicates with the Go backend via HTTP requests, providing a user interface for adding and searching words and synonyms. The system is designed to handle edge cases such as circular synonyms and large numbers of synonyms efficiently.

Technologies used:
- Go: Backend server implementation.
- React: Frontend user interface.
- gorilla/mux: HTTP router and dispatcher for Go.
- axios: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

## Features

- Add a new word to the system.
